<p>Mockup always comes to us when we try to break system dependency. The conventional mockup frameworks only allowed us to mock instance methods. So the <strong>static methods usually become to the death of testability</strong>.</p>

<p>Of course, we still have some way to make it become testable.</p>

<p>1. If the static methods invoke only happens in few classes, we could <strong>create an adaptor to isolate</strong> them. The implementation of adaptor is just simply delegation.</p>

<p>2. Unfortunately, sometimes your legacy system maybe full of static methods calling, they scatter in different tiers.</p>

<p>It indeed a bad smell, but before you refactor them, you may need to make them testable firstly. Now, jmockit comes to us.</p>

<p>"Tests can easily be written that will <strong>mock final classes, static methods, constructors</strong>, and so on. There are no limitations."</p>

<p>-- jmockit</p>

<p>The following example shows its ability to mock static methods.</p>

<p>//src file</p>

<p>public class ServiceFactory {</p>

<p>public static String getAService() {</p>

<p>return "real service";</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>//test file</p>

<p>import mockit.Mock;</p>

<p>import mockit.Mockit;</p>

<p>import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;</p>

<p>import org.junit.Test;</p>

<p>public class ServiceFactoryTest {</p>

<p>@Test</p>

<p>public void should_return_mock_service() {</p>

<p>Mockit.setUpMock(ServiceFactory.class, ServiceFactoryStub.class);</p>

<p>assertEquals("mock service", ServiceFactory.getAService());</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>private static class ServiceFactoryStub {</p>

<p>@Mock</p>

<p>public static String getAService() {</p>

<p>return "mock service";</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>}</p>

<p><strong>Caution:</strong></p>

<p>Make sure jmockit.jar appears before any JUnit jar file in the classpath. Otherwise, it will shows warning:</p>

<p>"WARNING: JMockit was initialized on demand, which may cause certain tests to fail;<br />
please check the documentation for better ways to get it initialized."</p>
